/**
 * Return the length of the longest substring without repeating characters
 * in s.
 * 
 * Example: s = "abcabcbb", the function should return 3 since the
 * required substring is "abc"
 * Example: s = "bbb", the function should return 1 since the required substring
 * is "b"
 * Example: s = "ututt", the function should return 2 since the required
 * substring is "ut"
 * 
 * Requirement: This algorithm should run in O(n) time.
 * Hint: Try to come up with an algorithm that does this in O(n^2) time,
 * then think about ways to optimize it.
