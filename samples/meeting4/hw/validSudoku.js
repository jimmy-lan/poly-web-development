/**
 * Check if board contains a valid sudoku.
 * Board is a 9*9 2D array of characters. Valid characters in board includes
 * the characters '1' to '9' and '.'. A '.' character indicates an empty
 * cell in the sudoku. Your job is to check whether the input board is valid.
 * 
 * We say that a sudoku board is valid if and only if:
 * 1. Each row contains digits 1-9 without repetition
 * 2. Each column contains digits 1-9 without repetition
 * 3. Each 3*3 subboxes contains digits 1-9 without repetition
 * (Recall our discussion in meeting 4)
 * 
 * A board can be *valid* even if it is not *solvable*. Only filled cells
 * (i.e. cells with characters from '1' to '9') needs to be validated, so
 * ignore empty cells.
 * 
 * Note: if this description is not clear enough for you to solve the problem,
 * recall our discussion during meeting 4.
 *
 * Requirement: Design an algorithm that runs as efficient as possible.
 * 
 * @param {character[][]} board
 * @return {boolean}
